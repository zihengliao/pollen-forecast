HEATMAP:
When the frontend requests tile (Z, X, Y):
    1. Backend checks Mongo for tile with key "Z_X_Y"
    2. If found and not expired:
            → Return cached PNG (no Google API call)
    3. If not found:
            → Fetch tile from Google API
            → Store PNG in Mongo/GridFS with timestamp
            → Return PNG to user


For individual point forecasting, caching is very hard since theres an infinite number
of points for possible forecasting if using longitude and latitude.
So need to set up a grid system. Use geohash:
User clicks map:
   ↓
lat,lng = -37.817,144.965
   ↓
geohash_6 = r3gx2q
   ↓
Check Mongo for "forecast_r3gx2q"
   ↓
If exists → return cached
If not → fetch forecast, save under that geohash
